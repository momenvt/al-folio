I am a PhD Student @[Viginia Tech](https://vt.edu){:target="\_blank"} since fall 2017, specializing in the field of Human-Computer Interaction. I am being co-advised by [Tanushree Mitra@UW](https://faculty.washington.edu/tmitra/){:target="\_blank"} and [Sang Won Lee](https://echolab.cs.vt.edu/sangwonlee/){:target="\_blank"}. My research interest lies in the intersection of computer science and communication, especially in designing interventions to help users navigate online information space. I am also working with [Mike Horning@CommSchool](https://liberalarts.vt.edu/departments-and-schools/department-of-communication/faculty/mike-horning.html){:target="\_blank"} in several projects. I apply both qualitative and quantitative methods in my research. See the projects and  publications for more detail. Before this, I recieved a bachelor's degree in computer science from [BUET](https://buet.ac.bd){:target="\_blank"} and worked @[Reve Systems](https://www.revesoft.com/){:target="\_blank"} as a software engineer.
